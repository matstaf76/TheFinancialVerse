        Greetings, young hero! I am <strong>The Iron Banker</strong>, sworn enemy of financial villains and guardian of smart money habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I will teach you the <span class="highlight">Basics of Banking</span>, your first shield against financial traps!
      </p>
    </section>

    <h1>The Basics of Banking</h1>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Understanding How Banks Work</h2>
      <p>
        Banks are the backbone of the financial world. They protect your money, help it grow, and make it easy to access when you need it. When you deposit money, the bank keeps it safe and sometimes even pays you interest. That same money helps others borrow to buy homes, start businesses, or pay for education.
      </p>

      <p>
        Learning the basics of banking helps you use financial tools wisely, from checking accounts to loans and credit cards. Knowing how the system works keeps you in control instead of paying unnecessary fees or falling for risky offers.

      <h2>🏦 Banking Basics (For Checking & Savings Accounts)</h2>
      <ul class="knowledge-list">
        <li>🏛️ <strong>Banks are money keepers.</strong> They keep your money safe and insured which is why it is better than hiding it in a sock drawer or in the mattress!</li>

        <li>💳 <strong>You can have two main types of accounts:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Checking account:</strong> for <em>spending and paying bills</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Savings account:</strong> for <em>storing and growing your money</em> over time.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>💰 <strong>Checking = Everyday Money.</strong> Use it with a debit card or checks to buy things or pay online.</li>

        <li>🏦 <strong>Savings = Future Money.</strong> Save up for something big — a bike, console, or adventure!</li>

        <li>📲 <strong>Banks use apps and ATMs</strong> so you can check balances, deposit, or withdraw money anytime.</li>

        <li>🌱 <strong>Interest helps your savings grow.</strong> The bank pays you a tiny bit for letting them hold your money.</li>

        <li>🩸 <strong>Overdrafts are trouble!</strong> Spending more than you have lets <a href="CountOverdraft.html"><span class="villain-name">Count Overdraft</span></a> attack your balance.</li>

        <li>🔁 <strong>Transfers move money</strong> between checking and savings with just a few taps.</li>

        <li>✨ <strong>Direct deposit can be paycheck magic.</strong> Your allowance or job pay can go straight into your account automatically.</li>

        <li>⚔️ <strong>Debit cards are not Credit cards.</strong> Debit uses <em>your money</em>; credit borrows <em>someone else’s</em> money.</li>

        <li>🕵️‍♂️ <strong>Keep your info secret.</strong> Never share your PIN, card number, or passwords — villains love that!</li>

        <li>💡 <strong>Good habit:</strong> Always check your balance before spending. That’s how heroes defeat <a href="CountOverdraft.html"><span class="villain-name">Count Overdraft</span></a> and <a href="TheSwipe.html"><span class="villain-name">The Swipe</span></a> every time.</li>
