        Jack the Ruiner is a shady fiend that can't figure out how to make more money honestly by increasing value.
      </p>      
      <p>
        <strong>So he decreases it!</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
         He ruins fun events and trips by price gouging, adding secret fees and bogus charges. He can releases swarms of <strong>Ancillary Aliens</strong> or even unleash <strong>ATM the Barbarian</strong> to pile on more costs!
        </p>
    <h2>A vile PRICE GOUGER!</h2>

        IRL, Jack the Ruiner represents all sudden and hidden fee scams on recreational activities. The jerk tries to ruin fun with hidden resort, cleaning fees and upcharges that you have no choice but to pay. This is booking a hotel for $200 a night, but then they add $20 more for "cleaning" or "resort fun." 
      </p>
        <p>
        It's paying extra for things you already paid for!
      </p>
      <p>  
        The "Jack the Ruiners" of the world ALSO ruin your fun with "trapped market price gouging." This is when you are charged an absurd price for items that are cheap outside of the business you are at.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is like when you are at an amusement park or arena event and you pay $10 for a $1 bottle of water. You are trapped and are <span class="debt">price gouged!</span></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="debt">That drains the money you had for fun, food and souvenirs, potentially ruining your good time!</span>
      </p>
      <p>
         <strong>Jack the Ruiner Strikes!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        What an awful villain! EVERYONE hates the Jack the Ruiners of the world!
      </p>
      <p>
        To defeat Jack the Ruiner YOU MUST:    research prices ahead of time, avoid businesses that are known for hidden fees or price gouging, and always ask about extra fees before committing to purchases or bookings. Knowledge and planning are your best defenses against his schemes!
