    <h1>Meet Jack the Ruiner!</h1>
    <p>Jack the Ruiner is a foggy slasher in a dark coat with a bloody ledger. He ruins fun trips by adding secret charges and can even release swarms of Ancillary Aliens to pile on more tricks!</p>
    <h2>What He Represents in Real Life</h2>
    <p>In real life, Jack the Ruiner is like hidden resort or cleaning fees. Think of booking a hotel for $200 a night, but then they add $20 more for "cleaning" or "resort fun" you didn't ask for. It's like paying extra for toys you don't use! Always read the full price before a trip to stop him. Jack the Ruiner also ruins your trip with "trapped market price gouging." This is when you are charged an absurd price for items that are cheap outside of the business you are at. This is when you are at an amusement park and you pay $10 for a $1 bottle of water. You are trapped and are price gouged. That drains the money you had for fun! Jack the Ruiner Strikes!</p>
