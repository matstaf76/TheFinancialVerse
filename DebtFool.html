      <h2>DebtFool's Game</h2>
      <p>
        DebtFool appears when you least expect! Smiling, charming, and offering what sounds like an easy way out. Maybe even the only way out!
      </p> 
      <p>
        His favorite weapons? They involve “Easy Credit.”
      </p> 
      <p>
        Whether it’s a payday loan, a rent-to-own scheme, or a store card that promises instant gratification, he knows exactly how to make your wallet bleed over time. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <span class="debt">The more he destroys your credit the more he can charge you next time!</span>

      <h2>His Modus Operandi</h2>
      <p>At first, his victims think they’ve won. 
      <p>
        A little money here, a shiny new appliance there, with no payments for months! 
      </p>  
      <p>
        But the contracts are how he feeds!  
      </p>
      <p>
      Interest builds.  Minimum paymets do not reduce the balance. Fees multiply. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Before long, those easy payments become a heavy chain of <span class="debt">-$50</span>, <span class="debt">-$200</span>, <span class="debt">-$1,000</span>... until escape feels impossible.</p>

      <h2>Another Financial Parasite!</h2>
      <p>
        Over time, the Debts of the Fool grow more sinister. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The glow of his offers fade, replaced by the cold light of overdue notices. He feeds on desperation — the more his victims struggle, the stronger he becomes and the more PREDATORY the credit offers get!
      </p>
      <p>
       He feeds on desperation! Like being caught in a FINANCIAL BEARTRAP, the more his victims struggle, the stronger he becomes and       
      </p>
      <p>
      <span class="debt">the more PREDATORY the credit offers get!</span> 
      </p>
      <img src="images/DebtFoolGotMoney.jpg" alt="DebtFool enraged" class="villain-image" />

      <p>The further you go down the road of debt, the more you struggle to be free like financial quicksand! </p>

      <img src="images/DebtFoolUnmaskedGotMoney.jpg" alt="DebtFool enraged" class="villain-image" />

      <p>DEBTFOOL CAN BE DEFEATED with discipline, and the SHIELDS OF KNOWLEDGE from the heroes of The FinancialVerse!</p>
      <h2>The IronBanker hates these guys!</h2>
      <img src="images/IronBankerDisapproves.jpg" alt="The IronBanker Disapproves!" class="villain-image" />
      <p>
        But the IronBanker cannot defeat him alone! You must learn to recognize DebtFool's tricks and avoid his easy credit traps!
