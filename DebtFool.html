      <h2>DebtFool's Game</h2>
      <p>DebtFool appears when you least expect! Smiling, charming, and offering what sounds like an easy way out. Maybe even the only way out! His favorite weapons? They involve “Easy Credit.” Whether it’s a payday loan, a rent-to-own scheme, or a store card that promises instant gratification, he knows exactly how to make your wallet bleed over time. The more he destroys your credit the more he can charge you next time!</p>

      <h2>His Modus Operandi</h2>
      <p>At first, his victims think they’ve won. A little money here, a shiny new appliance there with no payments for months! But the contracts are how he feeds! Interest builds. Minimum paymets do not reduce the balance. Fees multiply. Before long, those easy payments become a heavy chain of <span class="debt">-$50</span>, <span class="debt">-$200</span>, <span class="debt">-$1,000</span>... until escape feels impossible.</p>

      <h2>Another Financial Parasite!</h2>
      <p>Over time, the Debts of the Fool grow more sinister. The glow of his offers fade, replaced by the cold light of overdue notices. He feeds on desperation — the more his victims struggle, the stronger he becomes, the worse the credit offer get!</p>
