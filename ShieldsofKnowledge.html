        <li>Check your credit reports annually and dispute errors immediately.</li>

    <!-- VALUE -->
    <section id="value">
      <h2>Shield Four — The Principle of True Value</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Jack the Ruiner</strong> thrives on
        convincing you to pay for illusions or trapping you where you have no choice.  
        This shield teaches discernment to recognize when a purchase or service
        truly adds value to your life.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Before spending, ask: “Does this improve my life or just distract me?”</li>
        <li>Pay gladly for things that educate, empower, or create lasting good.</li>
        <li>Refuse to waste your money on empty fees. Question and negotiate against them whenever possible.</li>
        <li>Plan all of your expensive recreation like vacations, concerts and amusement park visits as far ahead as possible to avoid sudden fees and minimize the impact of trapped market price gouging.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you add real value to what you buy and what you sell, you enhance the customer experience, bring good memories,strengthen the entire society and improve everyone's quality of life.
