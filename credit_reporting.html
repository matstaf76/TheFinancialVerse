            <p>It's never too early or too late to start learning about it!</p>
            <p>No matter what has happened to your credit, you can deal with it!</p>

            <h1>What is Credit Reporting?</h1>
            <p>Credit reporting is a system where companies called Credit Bureaus collect information about your financial behavior and put it into a credit report. This report is used by lenders, landlords, and others to assess risk.</p>

            <h2>What is a Credit Report?</h2>
            <p>A credit report contains information gathered by credit bureaus, including:</p>
            <ul class="knowledge-list">
                <li>Number of credit cards and loans.</li>
                <li>Outstanding balances.</li>
                <li>Bill payment history.</li>
                <li>Bankruptcy filings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Who are these Credit Bureaus?</h1>
            <p>The Big 3 Credit Bureaus — <strong>Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion</strong> — collect financial information about individuals to create credit reports and scores.</p>

            <h1>How do Credit Bureaus make money?</h1>
            <h3>Selling Credit Reports and Scores</h3>
            <p>Credit bureaus sell reports and scores to lenders, landlords, insurance companies, and sometimes employers. They also charge companies to report information.</p>

            <h3>Subscription Services</h3>
            <p>For a monthly fee, consumers can get updates, alerts, and monitoring tools from credit bureaus.</p>

            <h3>Selling Analytical Services</h3>
            <p>Credit bureaus analyze their data to provide insights to businesses, like predicting who is most likely to pay on time.</p>

            <h2>Your credit report may differ between bureaus</h2>
            <p>Not all companies report to all three bureaus. Some only report negative information. Credit bureaus share information with each other, but accounts can be resold or reported multiple times.</p>
            <p><strong>You are not their customer; your credit report is their product.</strong></p>

            <h2>What is a Credit Score?</h2>
            <p>A credit score is a number summarizing your credit report. Higher scores indicate lower risk to lenders.</p>

            <h2>Why is Credit Reporting Important?</h2>
            <p>Credit reporting helps lenders determine loan approvals and interest rates. Good credit reports and high scores can get you better terms.</p>

            <h2>How Can You Improve Your Credit?</h2>
            <ul class="knowledge-list">
                <li>Pay bills on time.</li>
                <li>Don't borrow more than you can repay.</li>
                <li>Avoid applying for too much credit at once.</li>
                <li>Check credit reports regularly for errors.</li>
                <li>Dispute any negative items and request documentation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The credit system is set up to take advantage of people with low information. Educate yourself to maintain control.</p>
