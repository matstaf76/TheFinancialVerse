    <h1>Meet The Tollitician!</h1>
    <p>The Tollitician is a greddy pollitican who snaps away money with new taxes and tolls for the things that used to be a free or cheaper. He collects tolls and extras fees on roads and required government services your taxes already pay for!</p>
    <h2>What He Represents in Real Life</h2>
    <p>In real life, The Tollitician is the politicians and bureaucrats that want to increase taxes, tolls and fees like bridge tolls or excise charges. You drive over a bridge to go work one day and pay $5, but the next day it is $6! This is a rule-maker that can only make policies that punish people</p>
