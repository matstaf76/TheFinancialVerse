        The Tolliticians are a greedy polliticans who snap away prosperity with new taxes and tolls for the things that used to be a free or cheaper. They collects taxes, tolls and extras fees on roads and required government services your existing taxes should already pay for!</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        THEY WOULD TAX THE AIR YOU BREATH IF THEY COULD MEASURE IT!

      <p>
        They appoint family members or cronies to huge salaried government positions to spend the money they took from you in taxes! It's theft and extortion made legal for a ruling class like a Robin Hood Tale!

      <p>
        AND the services and projects that were supposed to happen, JUST DON'T! Roads stay in disrepair, bridges crumble, and public services decline while the Tolliticians insider trade stocks!    
      </p>
      <p>
        To defeat them: pay attention to what polticians are doing! Do not blindly support toll roads or tax increases! Hold them accountable with your vote!
