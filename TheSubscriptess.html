      <h2>The Trap of The Subscriptress</h2>
      <p>
        The Subscriptress lures her victims with sweet promises, “Try it for free!” she whispers, her glowing smile hiding the fine print.
        At first, it’s just a harmless trial. A month of streaming, a fitness app, or a “limited offer.”
      </p>

      </a>
      <p>
        Her victims don’t even feel the sting at first. It's a few dollars here, a few there. Maybe you even used the service for a while?
        But her magic is repetition. The Subscriptress thrives on your forgetfulness and distraction. SHE GETS UGLIER OVER TIME!

    <section class="modus">
      <h2>Her Modus Operandi</h2>
      <p>When you forget to cancel, her power grows with every quiet withdrawal of
        <span class="debt">-$9.99</span>… <span class="debt">-$19.99</span>… month after month AFTER MONTH!</p>

        <img src="images/TheSubscriptessGettingBad.jpg" alt="Subscriptress tightening control" class="villain-image" />
      </a>
      <p>She uses every tool of the modern digital age such as auto-renewals, hidden checkboxes, and of course the “free” trials that quietly bill your future.</p>

    <section class="escalation">
      <h2>The Endless Drain</h2>
      <p>
        The Subscriptress doesn’t strike you hard but she will strike forever. Eventually she turns into a MONSTER!
        A thousand small bites until your wallet runs dry. Like a small bloodsucking tick, she clings on to your finances, unnoticed!
      </p>

        </a>
        <p>
          The only defense is awareness! Watch your daily balances and monthly statements, cancel unused subscriptions,
          and never forget that even the smallest <span class="debt">-$5</span> can grow into a monster.

      <h2>How to Defeat Her</h2>
      <p>
        Knowledge is your armor. Set a reminder for every trial you start.
        Use prepaid cards or virtual wallets for subscriptions.
        Review your statements monthly. Every cancellation is a victory, every avoided charge weakens her grip.
        Every penny saved is a penny earned.
