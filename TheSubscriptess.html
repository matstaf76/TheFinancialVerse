      <h2>The Trap of The Subscriptress</h2>
      <p>
        The Subscriptress lures her victims with sweet promises: “Try it for free!” she whispers, her glowing smile hiding the fine print.  
        At first, it’s just a harmless trial, a month of streaming, a fitness app, or a “limited offer.”  
        When you forget to cancel, her power grows with every quiet withdrawal of <span class="debt">-$9.99</span>… <span class="debt">-$19.99</span>… month after month.

      <h2>Her Modus Operandi</h2>
      <p>
        Her victims don’t even feel the sting at first, a few dollars here, a few there. Maybe you even utilized the service for a small time?  
        But her magic is repetition. The Subscriptress thrives on your forgetfulness and distraction.  
        She uses every tool of the modern age: auto-renewals, hidden checkboxes, and “free” trials that quietly bill your future.

      <h2>The Endless Drain</h2>
      <p>
        The Subscriptress doesn't strikes hard, she strikes forever.  
        A thousand small bites until your wallet runs dry.

        </a>
        <p>The only defense is awareness!  Watch your daily balances and monthly statements, cancel unused subscriptions,  
        and never forget that even the smallest <span class="debt">-$5</span> can and will grow into a monster.</p>

      <h2>How to Defeat Her</h2>
      <p>
        Knowledge is your armor. Set reminders for every trial you start.  
        Use prepaid cards or virtual wallets for subscriptions.  
        Review your statements monthly. Every cancellation is a victory — every avoided charge weakens her grip.
