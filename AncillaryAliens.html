        I don't know where they came from but they didn't used to be such a problem and they get worse all the time!

        The  <span class="debt">Ancillary Aliens</span>  are slimy creatures that burst out of travel and recreation plans! They multiply like a hive and spread like a plague adding surprise extras, sent by a  <span class="debt">Jack the Ruiner!</span>

        In real life, Ancillary Aliens are like  <span class="debt">"convenience fees"</span> on concert tickets or  <span class="debt"> airline extra fees.</span>  on your travel plans.
         You buy a plane ticket for $100, but then they charge $25 more for your seat or bag. It's like paying for a ride but extra for sitting down! Check all costs when flying to zap these aliens away.

      <p>
        The only way we can defeat them is TOGETHER! Check business reviews about who charges for what. Do research and specifically ASK about <span class="debt">all fees or extra charges.</span>   
        It is important to ask about what is <span class="debt">COMMON BUT NOT INCLUDED</span>  in your purchases and plans. DO NOT give your business to companies caught that charging hidden fees. If it happens to you be sure to leave a review somewhere telling others! Knowledge is your shield.
      </p>
      <p>
  Here are the most common hidden or extra charges you’ll encounter when buying concert tickets:
</p>

<p>
  🎟️ <span class="debt">Service Fee / Convenience Fee</span> — Supposedly covers “processing” the online order, 
  but often adds <strong>10–30%</strong> of the ticket price.
</p>

<p>
  💻 <span class="debt">Order Processing Fee</span>   Another name for doing what the website already does automatically.
</p>

<p>
  🏛️ <span class="debt">Venue Fee / Facility Charge</span>   A cut taken by the venue “for maintenance,” 
  even though you already paid for entry.
</p>


<p>
  📱 <span class="debt">Mobile Delivery Fee</span>   Yes, they sometimes charge extra just to email you your tickets.
</p>

<p>
  🚗 <span class="debt">Parking or Entry Fee</span>   Hidden until checkout, especially at stadiums or outdoor venues.
</p>

<p>
  💵 <span class="debt">Resale Markups</span>   When third-party platforms add their own percentage or 
  dynamic pricing on top of the base cost.
