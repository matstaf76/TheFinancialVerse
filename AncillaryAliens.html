        I don't know where they came from but they didn't used to be such a problem and they get worse all the time!

        The  <span class="debt">Ancillary Aliens</span>  are slimy creatures that burst out of travel and recreation plans! They multiply like a hive and spread like a plague adding surprise extras, sent by a  <span class="debt">Jack the Ruiner!</span>
      </p>

        In real life, Ancillary Aliens are like  <span class="debt">"convenience fees"</span> on concert tickets or  <span class="debt"> airline extra fees.</span>  on your travel plans.
         You buy a plane ticket for $100, but then they charge $25 more for your seat or bag. It's like paying for a ride but extra for sitting down! Check all costs when flying to zap these aliens away.

      <p>
        The only way we can defeat them is TOGETHER! Check business reviews about who charges for what. Do research and specifically ASK about <span class="debt">all fees or extra charges.</span>   
        It is important to ask about what is <span class="debt">COMMON BUT NOT INCLUDED</span>  in your purchases and plans. DO NOT give your business to companies caught that charging hidden fees. If it happens to you be sure to leave a review somewhere telling others! Knowledge is your shield.
