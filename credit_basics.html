            <p><strong>Your Credit Report</strong></p>
            <p>This is a detailed record of your credit history. It includes information about your loans, credit cards, and payment habits. It’s like a financial resume that shows how responsible you’ve been with money.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your Credit Score</strong></p>
            <p>This is a number between 300 and 850 that represents your creditworthiness. The higher the number, the better. It’s like a financial health score that lenders use to decide if they should lend you money.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Credit Bureaus</strong></p>
            <p>These are organizations (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax) that collect and maintain your credit information. They’re like detectives that keep track of your financial behavior.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Lenders</strong></p>
            <p>These are banks or other financial institutions that lend money. They’re like judges who use your credit report and score to decide if they should lend you money and at what terms you should be offered.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Remember</strong></p>

            <p>The system is in place to charge you money. It helps to pay your bills on time and not borrow more money than you can repay. Keep a low <a href="debt-to-income_ratio.html">DEBT TO INCOME RATIO</a> and a low <a href="credit_utilization_ratio.html">CREDIT UTILIZATION RATIO</a>. This will help you achieve and maintain a high credit score.</p>
