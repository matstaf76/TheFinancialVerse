            <h2>What Is a Debt-to-Income Ratio?</h2>
            <p>
                Your Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) is a simple math formula lenders use to figure out
                how much money you can realistically afford to pay back and therefore, how much
                you can safely borrow.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>If you total up all of the bills you pay every month and divide that number by your income, the result is your DTI.</strong>
            </p>

            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p>
                Let’s use easy numbers. Suppose you earn <strong>$10,000 per month</strong>.
                After adding up all your bills, the total comes to <strong>$2,500 per month</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                That means your Debt-to-Income Ratio is:
                <br><strong>2,500 ÷ 10,000 = 0.25 → 25% DTI</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Your total monthly bills are 25% of your income. 
            </p>
            <h2>What Is Considered a Good DTI?</h2>
            <p>
                A DTI below <strong>33%</strong> is considered healthy and acceptable by most lenders.
                The higher the number, the harder it becomes to get approved for credit or good terms.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most lenders will NOT approve you for anything if your DTI is above <strong>50%</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>The Lower Your DTI, the Better</h2>
            <p>
                A low DTI makes you far more appealing to lenders even if you have limited or no credit.
            </p>
            <p>    This is why a young rockstar or athlete with million$ of dollar$ but zero credit history can finance a Lamborghini, while
                someone earning minimum wage with an 830 credit score but a DTI of 65% will be denied for a used Chevy.

            <h2>Remember!</h2>
            <p>
                The system is designed to justify charging you as much as possible. Paying your
                bills on time and not borrowing more than you can afford helps you maintain a low DTI—
                giving you better financial opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
                A low DTI also means you have enough disposable income to enjoy life. This is the power
                of living within or below your means. You get comfort and low stress. 
            </p>

            <p>
                A high DTI means you're working just to pay bills and feeling the squeeze of financial pressure. So, everyday feels like a struggle even if you have nice things.
